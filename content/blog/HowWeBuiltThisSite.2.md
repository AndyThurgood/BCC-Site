Having had a static site for boxconcepts.co.uk for some time, we decided we wanted to update the site to allow for text based content change and to also introduce a blog function.

Having spoken with one of the new UK consultancies about helping them with an assignment, we happened upon a blog whilst doing some research, the blog talked about building a static site with a CI pipeline direct from github, using markdown as a way to build content. It sounded interesting and so started our quest to re-factor the bc site to use Phenomic and Netlify.
